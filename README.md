# Oxfored-Sun-Hours


The task is to define this nested list in a program and do the following data
analysis.

a.) Compute the average number of sun hours for each month during the total data
period (1929–2009).

b.)  Which month has the best weather according to the means found in the preceding
task?

c.) For each decade, 1930–1939, 1940–1949, : : :, 2000–2009, compute the aver-
age number of sun hours per day in January and December. For example, use
December 1949, January 1950, : : :, December 1958, and January 1959 as data
for the decade 1950–1959. Are there any noticeable differences between the
decades?
