# Oxfored-Sun-Hours


The task is to define this nested list in a program and do the following data
analysis.
 Compute the average number of sun hours for each month during the total data
period (1929–2009).
 Which month has the best weather according to the means found in the preceding
task?
 For each decade, 1930–1939, 1940–1949, : : :, 2000–2009, compute the aver-
age number of sun hours per day in January and December. For example, use
December 1949, January 1950, : : :, December 1958, and January 1959 as data
for the decade 1950–1959. Are there any noticeable differences between the
decades?
